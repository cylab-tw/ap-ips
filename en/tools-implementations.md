## Tools & Implementations
AP-IPS promotes the use of reference implementations, open-source tools, and test servers to support learning and adoption. Sample FHIR resources, validation tools, and implementation examples are shared to facilitate participation.
* [IPS Online Validator](https://validator.dicom.tw/)
   - Upload FHIR JSON directly and validated through the web interface. This tool performs validation based on various FHIR IG specifications including IPS, TW Core IG, etc.
   - During validation, the FHIR JSON must include the meta.profile information. Please refer to the [user guide](https://validator.dicom.tw/app/docs/) for details.
* [IPS Viewer](https://www.ipsviewer.com/)
* [SMART Health Cards with SD-JWT](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fixing-all-nothing-problem-health-data-sharing-fhir-josh-mandel-md-9k6gc)
* [Selective Disclosure for JSON Web Tokens(SD-JWT)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9901)
