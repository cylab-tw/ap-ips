# Introduction
The Asia Pacific International Patient Summary Alliance (AP-IPS) was established to support international healthcare interoperability by focusing on the International Patient Summary (IPS) as a foundational use case.

## How AP-IPS Works
AP-IPS operates as a collaborative, country-driven interoperability framework that enables participating Asia-Pacific economies to jointly define, test, and validate interoperable IPS through collaborative specifications and Plugathon-based validation.

### 1. Regional Needs and Use-Case Identification
Participating economies—through healthcare authorities, standards organizations, academic institutions, hospitals, and industry representatives—collectively identify cross-border clinical scenarios where the IPS is required, such as emergency care, referral continuity, disaster response, and patient mobility. National inputs are consolidated to reflect regional clinical and operational needs, ensuring that IPS exchange requirements are grounded in real-world practice rather than isolated technical assumptions.

### 2. Joint Specification Development
Based on agreed regional use cases, AP-IPS establishes multinational specification working groups, composed of representatives from participating countries. Rather than unilateral specification development, AP-IPS emphasizes co-creation, where all participating countries contribute equally to the definition of interoperable IPS exchange specifications. These groups collaboratively define:
* IPS exchange profiles and constraints
* FHIR-based data elements and extensions
* Terminology alignment and localization considerations
* Security, transport, and governance assumptions

### 3. Open Reference Implementations and Tooling
To accelerate adoption and ensure consistency, AP IPS encourages the development of open-source reference implementations, validation tools, and sample datasets that lower barriers to entry and improve implementation quality across the region. These artifacts serve as practical guidance for:
* National implementers
* Healthcare providers
* Vendors and startups
* Research and innovation communities

### 4. Asia-Pacific Plugathon
AP-IPS conducts an annual Asia Pacific Plugathon, modeled after IHE Connectathon principles but focused specifically on IPS exchange. Participation includes healthcare institutions, system vendors, startups, and national initiatives, fostering a neutral, vendor-independent testing environment. During the Plugathon:
* Implementers test system-to-system IPS exchanges based on AP-IPS specifications;
* Cross-country interoperability is validated in realistic scenarios;
* Technical and semantic issues are identified collaboratively.

### 5. Alignment with International Standards
Results from Plugathon testing and pilot deployments are systematically reviewed by AP-IPS working groups. This establishes a continuous improvement loop, ensuring that AP-IPS specifications remain clinically relevant, technically sound, and internationally aligned. AP-IPS does not replace global standards. Instead, it acts as a regional convergence platform, consolidating Asia-Pacific implementation experience and feeding it back into 
* HL7 IPS Working Groups,
* IHE international domain committees, and
* Other relevant international standardization activities.
