## Founding Statement
1. The AP-IPS is founded on the shared recognition that cross-border healthcare interoperability is essential to modern healthcare delivery. As patient mobility increases and healthcare systems become more interconnected, the ability to securely exchange essential clinical information across national boundaries is no longer optional—it is a necessity.

2. AP-IPS is established to serve as a neutral, collaborative platform that advances the adoption of the HL7 FHIR International Patient Summary through real-world testing, technical collaboration, and regional alignment. By leveraging the proven methodologies of Plugathons, the alliance bridges the gap between standards and implementation.

3. The founding members commit to openness, transparency, and international cooperation, with the shared goal of improving continuity of care, patient safety, and healthcare quality across the Asia-Pacific region. Through AP-IPS, we aspire to contribute meaningfully to the global interoperability ecosystem and empower patients and healthcare providers alike.
