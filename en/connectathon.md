## Connectathon
* IHE Connectathons provide a structured, profile-driven testing environment where participants validate interoperability using IHE profiles and HL7 international standards. Within AP-IPS, Connectathon activities focus on cross-border IPS exchange scenarios, alignment of national FHIR implementation guides, and verification of real-world interoperability between systems from different countries.
* Key objectives include:
  - Validating standards conformance and interoperability
  - Identifying gaps between specifications and real-world implementation
  - Strengthening regional alignment with international standards

### What is a Connectathon?
Connectathon is a portmanteau of the words **Connectivity** and **Marathon**. It is an interoperability testing event conducted over several consecutive days (typically three to five days), during which participants meet **face-to-face** to test interoperability among their developed systems.

Participants implement systems based on specific **profiles** and **clinical or operational scenarios**. These profiles are typically structured by decomposing requirements into **actors** and **transactions**, where communication between actors is defined using open, internationally recognized standards such as HL7, DICOM, IEEE, OSI, and other international or industry-standard specifications.

### Purpose of a Connectathon
The primary objective of a Connectathon is to verify interoperability among systems developed in accordance with specified standards and profiles. Prior to the event, participants may prepare and test their systems using open-source testing tools or their own development environments. A Connectathon provides a structured and rigorous validation environment, enabling participants to collaboratively test interoperability between products. Standardized technical frameworks allow systems to be tested in a manner consistent with real-world deployment or publication conditions.

### Benefits of Participation
Organizations participating in a Connectathon can:
* Validate whether their products conform to relevant standards;
* Test interoperability with systems from other vendors using real-world use cases;
* Rapidly identify and resolve technical integration and interface issues through close, collaborative problem-solving.

During the event, participants conduct live connection tests with other systems to verify compliance with international standards. Any non-conformant issues identified can often be corrected within a short timeframe. Connectathon testing environments support the validation of tens of thousands of transactions, and results are evaluated by neutral Connectathon Monitors, who independently assess and confirm interoperability outcomes.

### After the Connectathon
Upon completion, results are published in a **Connectathon Results Matrix**, allowing stakeholders to review verified interoperability outcomes. Through Connectathon activities, industry participants foster data exchange, mutual collaboration, and cooperative development, ultimately enabling the creation of products with **global market competitiveness**.

### Achieving Healthcare IT Interoperability Through Collaboration
To promote interoperability between healthcare IT users and vendors, the following key practices are essential:
* Clearly defining **use cases**;
* Identifying the **information** and **processes** required to support those use cases;
* Implementing information exchange using **existing international standards**;
* Participating in **annual Connectathons** to demonstrate system **conformance**;
* Encouraging close collaboration among **care providers, IT professionals, and vendors** to jointly define standards and common guidelines.
In this collaborative model, care providers contribute real-world clinical challenges, IT professionals and vendors develop standards-compliant solutions to address those needs, and healthcare organizations procure systems that conform to shared guidelines and interoperability requirements.
